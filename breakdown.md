## Nerual Net Architecture:
- Nodes are data
- Edges in the graph are generated by doing something like KNN on the data.
- Neural networks used for aggregation use pathway hierarchy. 

The edges help model be aware of information regarding similar procedures taking place with other networks. This is the motivation behind the change. Encoding a priori mdoel knowledge.

## Data:

- P1000_data_CNA_paper.csv: 
Columns: Cancer related genes
Rows: {sample_id}_{tissue_location}
Cell:
0. No copy
1. gain 
2. high-level amplification

## Reactome DAta:
- "ReactomePathwaysRelation.txt": and edge list of the pathway connections.
- "ReactomePathways.txt" keeps description of genes.

## Breakdown:
- loade_and_merge_tables():
 Does an innter join between three datasets
- build-reactome-network():
 Build reactome network from ReactomePathwaysRelation.txt
- PrepareAnnData(): 
- prepare_graph_data():



## Setting up model with SCVI.
1. Training Plan
    1. Configure optimizers
    2. Define training setp
    3. Define Validation step
2. Training Runner
